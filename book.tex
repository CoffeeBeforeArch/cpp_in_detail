\chapter{Introduction}

From databases and web browsers to operating systems and compilers, C++ can be found almost everywhere. This along with a incredibly active community makes it a great time to start learning C++!

\section{Why This Book on C++?}

Out of all the great books on C++, why should you pick this one? Here is a list of reasons!

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{It's free:} This is book (and its source) will always be free to download
  \item \textbf{It can be updated:} Printed books can not be updated. With a digital book, I can make modifications as new standards of C++ get approved, or correct errors in the text.
  \item \textbf{It fills in a gap left by other books:} Many entry level books focus solely on the C++ language, and avoid talking about implementation-specific details. This book breaks this mold by discussing these details which can be increadibly imprortant in practice.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intended Audience}

This book was written as a companion piece to my YouTube series \textbf{C++ Crash Course}. As such, the intended audience is expected to have no prior background in C++ programming.

Having some knowledge of basic programming concepts (e.g., types, functions, etc.) would be useful.

\section{Environment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Operating System: } Ubuntu 20.04
  \item \textbf{Compiler: } GCC 10.2
  \item \textbf{Processor: } Intel x86\-64
\end{itemize}

\section{About the Author}

My name is Nick, and I'm a computer systems architect working on deep learning accelerator performance in the San Francisco Bay Area.

My start in programming came during my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering where I took \textit{Engineering Programming with C}. While I enjoyed this course, I did not take any more dedicated programming classes during this degree (although I did some basic MATLAB and Python programming as required by various coursework).

My start with C++ came during my Ph.D. (incomplete), where I used and developed the GPGPU architecture simulator, GPGPU-Sim. This simulator (largely written in C++), was where I spent a large portion of my time.

After approximately one year of writing C-like C++, I decided to take a more serious approach in learning the language. There was no single book or resource I used to learn the language. Instead, I would run across a piece of C++ I didn't understand (something like a container or template), search the internet to see out how it worked, then write a minimal example to solidify my understanding. These minimal examples are what eventually became my YouTube series \textbf{C++ Crash Course}.

From then on, C++ and high performance software became one of my passions. I began writing benchmarks in C++, writing blog posts, and doing teaching livestreams.
