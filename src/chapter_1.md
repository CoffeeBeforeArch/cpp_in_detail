# Chapter 1 - Introduction

C++ is one of the most prominent programming languages today, and has greatly evolved from the original "C with classes" of the 1990s and 2000s. It can also be found running almost evertwhere, from tiny embedded devices, to the world's largest supercomputers accelerated by GPUs. With so many companies using it in major parts of their code base, and an incredibly active community, it's a great time to learn C++.

## Why Read This Book on C++?

Many introductory books on C++ focus solely on the language. While these books have their place, many people want to understand what is going on "under the hood", and how their code goes from text on a screen to instructions executing on a CPU. For those people interested in:

- The C++ language
- Compilers
- Low-level assembly
- How the C++ Standard Library is implemented
- Tools related to C++ development

This book is for you!

## What Does This Book Cover?

This book covers three broad areas:

- The C++ language and standard libary implementation
- C++ compilation and execution
- C++ development tools

In each chapter, we'll look at snippets of code that show off different parts of the C++ language. We'll then look at how our high-level source code is translated into assembly, and use various tools to show off things like debugging, performance analysis, and anlyzing binaries.

## Background

This book is geared towards beginner and intermediate-level programmers that are interested in learning how software, compilers, and hardware work together to run applications. Readers are not expected to have an extensive background in programming, compilers, or computer architecture. However, having introductory knowledge in each of these areas is beneficial.

## Setup

This version of the book was covers information specific to C++ compiled on a Linux system with the GCC 10 compiler, with an x86-64 processor.

The exact setup used for this books was:

- O.S.: Ubuntu 20.04
- Compiler: gcc-10.2
- Processor: Intel i7-9700
